# Learning Rust with Data Structs
A repository for learning rust better by implementing some classic data structures and algorithms.

## Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a tree based datastructure, where each node has at most two childrent. One
child has a key which is less than the parent, denoted the left child, and one child has a key
which is greater than the parent called the right child.
